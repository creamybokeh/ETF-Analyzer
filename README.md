## Technologies

This application is compatible with Python 3.9.
The Pandas, Numpy and SQLAlchemy libraries were used along with hvplot and must be installed in order to run the program correctly. Voila is used to display and interact with the program.

Pandas is used for data science and analysis and machine learning.

Numpy is used for scientific computing in Python.

HvPlot allows for the creation of interactive graphs and plots of data.
